                        At first, JavaScript may seem quite simple. Yet the language is significantly more nuanced, powerful, and complex than one would initially be led to believe. Many of JavaScript's subtleties lead to a number of common problems—10 of which we discuss here—that keep code from behaving as intended. It's important to be aware of and avoid these pitfalls in one's quest to become a master JavaScript developer.

                        Powerful JavaScript-based libraries and frameworks for single page application (SPA) development, graphics and animation, and server-side JavaScript platforms are nothing new. JavaScript has become ubiquitous in the world of web app development and is therefore an increasingly important skill to master.

                         At first, JavaScript may seem quite simple. Indeed, building basic JavaScript functionality into a web page is a fairly straightforward task for any experienced software developer, even if they’re new to JavaScript. Yet the language is significantly more nuanced, powerful, and complex than one would initially believe. In fact, many of JavaScript’s subtleties can lead to a number of common problems that keep it from working—10 of which we discuss here. It is important to be aware of and avoid these issues on your journey to become a master JavaScript developer.
                         <br><br>
                         As JavaScript coding techniques and design patterns have become increasingly sophisticated over the years, there’s been a corresponding increase in the proliferation of self-referencing scopes within callbacks and closures, which are a fairly common source of “this confusion” causing JavaScript issues.
