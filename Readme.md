    SIGN-UP validation

    After giving valid datas to the form, when submit button clicks, 
    a) The background color of the section changes to green gradient.
    b) Above the signup form, a new div will be created with green background and inside of it,the content will be :
        `Hey ${user}, uour signup is successful`
    c) The complete user datas will be displayed in the console.    

    SIGN-IN validation

    After giving  valid datas to the form, when submit button clicks , it will be redirected to index.html file
